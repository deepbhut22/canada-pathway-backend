# Instructions:
- For each stream, determine if the user is "Eligible" or "Not Eligible."
- If "Eligible," explain why they match.
- If "Not Eligible," explain clearly what requirement they are missing (e.g., language, no job offer, no Canadian study, Express Entry profile missing).
- Always reply in JSON format.
- Output array must have:
  - province
  - stream_name
  - status ("Eligible" or "Not Eligible")
  - reason (short explanation)

- Also create a "suggestions" array:
  - Recommend actions the user can take to become eligible for more streams (e.g., improve IELTS, find a job offer).

Important:
- Group the streams together by province.
- No free text outside JSON.
- Keep the reasons compact but clear.
