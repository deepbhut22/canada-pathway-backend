- Provide a detailed **score breakdown** including:
  - Core Human Capital (max: 500) - also include why the score is what it is
  - Spouse Factors (max: 40) - also include why the score is what it is
  - Skill Transferability (max: 100) - also include why the score is what it is
  - Additional Points (max: 600) - also include why the score is what it is
- Return the score for each category **with the maximum possible** included.
